description: How to work effectively with AI coding assistants.

This section is coming soon. It will cover:

- AI as a thinking partner, not just a code generator
- Writing specs with AI assistance
- Rules files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.)
- Reviewing AI-generated output
- The feedback loop between specs and implementation

For now, start with the [Get Started guide](/spec-driven-site/get-started/).
