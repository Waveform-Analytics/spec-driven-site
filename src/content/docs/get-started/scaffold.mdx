title: Scaffold a Project
description: Run the scaffolding script to bootstrap a spec-driven project.
---

import { FileTree, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The scaffolding script creates a project structure with spec templates ready to go. No dependencies—just Python.

## Quick start

```bash
curl -O https://waveform-analytics.github.io/spec-driven-site/scaffold.py
python scaffold.py
```

The script will ask for:

1. **Project name** — Used for the directory and in generated files
2. **One-line description** — What the project does
3. **Project type** — Affects which templates are included:
   - *Data pipeline* — Adds data flow architecture template
   - *Analysis tool* — General structure
   - *Algorithm implementation* — Adds algorithm and validation templates
   - *General* — Basic structure
4. **AI tool** — Creates the appropriate config file:
   - *Claude Code* → `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
   - *Cursor* → `.cursorrules`
   - *GitHub Copilot* → `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - *Other/None* → Skips AI config

## What you get

<FileTree>
- your-project/
  - specs/
    - **spec-format.md** How to write specs (reference this!)
    - **00-overview.md** Your project overview (start here)
    - 01-requirements/
      - functional.md Requirements template
    - 02-architecture/
      - data-flow.md If you chose "Data pipeline"
    - 03-implementation/
    - 04-algorithms/ If you chose "Algorithm implementation"
      - algorithm-template.md
    - 05-validation/ If you chose "Algorithm implementation"
      - validation-plan.md
    - 99-decisions/
      - adr-000-template.md Decision record template
  - src/
  - tests/
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md If you chose Claude Code
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - README.md
</FileTree>

## The templates

Each generated file includes **inline guidance** explaining what to write. The guidance appears in HTML comments or bracketed placeholders:

```markdown
<!--
This is your project's overview spec. It should answer:
- What problem does this project solve?
- Who is it for?
- What are the key capabilities?

Delete these instructions once you've written the overview.
-->

## Problem Statement

[What problem are you solving? Why does it matter?]
```

Fill in the brackets, delete the comments as you go.

## After scaffolding

<Steps>

1. `cd your-project`

2. Open `specs/00-overview.md` and describe your project

3. Read `specs/spec-format.md` to understand how specs work here

4. Run `git init` to start version control

5. Start a conversation with your AI assistant about requirements

</Steps>

## Next step

Once you have a project, [write your first spec](/spec-driven-site/get-started/first-spec/).
